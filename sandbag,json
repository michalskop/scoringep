Only such an ambitious target will really ensure the EU can take a leadership role in the international negotiations on a new international climate agreement.<br />In its resolution on the 2013 UNFCCC conference in Warsaw, the EP rapporteur proposed to substantially increase the 40% milestone as currently identified by the European Commission in their low carbon roadmap to a 50% target. An amendment was tabled to delete this paragraph meaning the EP would not call for more ambitious targets. We included the vote on this amendment in the overview.",

Given that in 2012 EU domestic emissions have fallen to -18% and when including international offsets emission have even fallen to -27%, CAN Europe calls upon the EU to adopt a domestic emission reduction target of -30% by 2020 and when including international credits the EU should move to -40%.<br />In the framework of the EP's discussion on the European Commission's 2050 Low Carbon Roadmap, an amendment was tabled that called for increasing the EU's 2020 ambition (not up to the level CAN Europe is calling for but at least moving in the right direction).

There were huge expectations that through engaging political leaders the world could make a substantial step forward at the climate change summit in Copenhagen in December 2009. It turned out to be a small step.<br />The EU had an important role to play in Copenhagen, and the European Parliament resolution in preparation of Copenhagen highlighted a number of clear elements of that role, including the issue of the EU's contribution to the mitigation effort, the EU's contribution to financing climate action in poor countries, and the need to expand the legal regime with binding commitments from all countries.

It is this compromise that was tabled to the EP Plenary, and given its compromise nature, was supported by a large amount of MEPs, as a whole and therefore the vote on the full Directive is included in this overview.",
