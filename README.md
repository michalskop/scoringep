scoringep
=========

A project to rate and display MEPs ratings over 11 votes on climate policy since 2009. 

Votes and categories are stored in sandbag.json. 

Template is in campaigningtool.txt and we'll make a form to automate making the json file going forward. 

Currently we're using static json files for each MEP queried for these votes but we'll make it more re-usable. 

Data and analysis from Sandbag Climate Campaign, eu-parlameter, CAN Europe and Friends of the Earth
