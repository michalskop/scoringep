The extraction of these fuels, like shale gas, leads to ground-water contamination, serious health impacts, and significantly higher carbon emissions than other fossil fuels.Friends of the Earth Europe believes that if these forms of gas and oil are exploited in Europe, our climate and renewable energy targets will be put in jeopardy and unacceptable risks will be imposed on communities and the environment.",
